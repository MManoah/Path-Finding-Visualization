## How To Use
1. You can change the starting and goal node locations by selecting the appropriate selection in the "Change Node" drop down menu then clicking on the location you want on the board.
2. You can add walls by selecting "Wall Node" in the Change Node drop down. Then click down your mouse and drag where you want the walls on the board.
3. You can change the speed of the visualisation by selecting a speed in the "Animation Speed" drop down.
4. Use random walls to generate random walls
5. Select an algorithm in the drop down menu.
6. Press Go
7. Reset will clear the board
## The Algorithms
Uninformed searches do not have heuristic values while informed searches do.
### Depth-First
Depth-First search is an uninformed any-path algorithm, it does not guarantee the shortest path.

### Breadth-First
Breadth-First search is an uninformed any-path algorithm, it does not guarantee the shortest path. 

### Best-First
Best-First search is an informed any-path algorithm, it does not guarantee the shortest path. 

### Uniform-Cost
Uniform-Cost search is an uninformed optimal-path algorithm, it does guarantee the shortest path. 

### A*
A* search is an informed optimal-path algorithm, it does guarantee the shortest path.
